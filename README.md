# Big-Data-Project-ELK
This a Project for the ING5 Class of Big Data at ECE Paris;
Members of the group : Alexis DIREZ, Neil SEGARD, Olivia DALMASSO

The project has to focus on Open Source distributed systems. For doing that we choose ElasticSearch (a plateform distributed systems). 

# Progress of the project
We test several uses cases and technologies with Elasticsearch. 
The goal was to implement Elasticsearch with two others Open Source distributed systems : Nifi (Dataflow system) and Kafka. 
We present our technical results in the several branches of this project. But the architecture/design is presented here in the main. 

# All technologies involved in our project and its uses cases

## Elasticsearch

## Kibana

## Logstash and Filebeats

## Nifi

## Docker

## Kafka

# Uses cases

## Ingestion of data in ElasticSearch with Nifi

### Description of the Use Case

### Technologies involved

### Architecture of the project 

### Implementation of Code (Technical projects)

It will be explained in each branch (with steps to implement it and a list of problems encountered) : 
- Branch Ingestion of CV's Data
- Branch Ingestion of Tweets in the field of Big Data
- Branch Ingestion of CSV (People Profile)
