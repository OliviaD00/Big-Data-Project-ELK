# Big-Data-Project-ELK
This a Project for the ING5 Class of Big Data at ECE Paris;
Members of the group : Alexis DIREZ, Neil SEGARD, Olivia DALMASSO

The project has to focus on Open Source distributed systems. For doing that we choose ElasticSearch (a plateform distributed systems). 

# Progress of the project
We test several uses cases and technologies with Elasticsearch. 
The goal was to implement Elasticsearch with two others Open Source distributed systems : Nifi (Dataflow system) and Kafka. 
We present our technical results in the several branches of this project. But the architecture/design is presented here in the main. 

# All technologies involved in our project and its uses cases

## Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is a distributed, open source search and analytics engine for all types of data. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine, it uses JSON documents to store Data. It allows some powerful queries with a system of score and a lot of possibilities of aggregation. It is developed in Java. It is often used with the ELK suite (Elasticsearch - Logstash - Kibana), allowed this distributed open source engine to complete extract-load-transform actions, aggregations and storage of documents and at the end monitoring and data vizualisation : a complete tool ! 


## Kibana

Kibana is the Datavisualisation tool of the ELK suite. It allows us to create some visualisations and Dashboard (quite useful for monitoring) with data loaded on Elasticsearch. Kibana gives us also the possibility to implement Machine Learning on the Datasets to try to make some previsions.

# Uses cases

## Ingestion of data in ElasticSearch with Nifi

### Description of the Use Case

Companies use cases : I want to load, extract, transform and make some dataflow with only one tool 

### Technologies involved



### Architecture of the project 

### Implementation of Code (Technical projects)

It will be explained in each branch (with steps to implement it and a list of problems encountered) : 
- Branch Ingestion of CV's Data
- Branch Ingestion of Tweets in the field of Big Data
- Branch Ingestion of CSV (People Profile)
